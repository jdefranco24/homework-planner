I have created a day planner for all the working people out there. It allows you to save appointments for work day and keeps them there until deleted. It is a great tool for anyone who needs help keeping an up to date schedule of their day. 

Simply select the time frame you are looking for and write what you have going on that time. When you are done select the save button on the right side to save you updates.
